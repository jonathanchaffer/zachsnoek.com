## Commit Message Guidelines
* Be succinct but descriptive
* Reference only one change per commit
* Use sentence case but omit full stops (e.g., "Refactor route creation")
* Begin with a base verb (e.g., "Refactor blog component," not "Refactored blog component")
* Use exact casing and extension if referencing a filename or package (e.g., "Fix typo in README.md," "Upgrade react-router-dom")
